# Purchase-Power-Prediction-based-on-Salary

**Project Title: Purchase Power Prediction based on Salary**

**Overview:**
The "Purchase Power Prediction based on Salary" project aims to develop a predictive model that estimates an individual's purchasing power based on their age, estimated salary, and historical purchase behavior. By leveraging data cleaning, visualization, and a variety of machine learning models, the project provides valuable insights into consumer spending patterns. The utilization of hyperparameter tuning and RandomSearch CV 1 enhances the models' performance, ensuring accurate and efficient predictions.

**Business Perspective:**
Understanding and predicting purchase power is crucial for businesses seeking to tailor their marketing and sales strategies. By accurately estimating an individual's purchasing capacity, businesses can optimize their offerings, pricing, and promotions. This project provides a valuable tool for businesses to target their products or services to the right audience, maximizing customer satisfaction and enhancing overall sales performance.

**Key Features:**

1. **Data Collection and Cleaning:**
   - Compiled a dataset with essential features such as age, estimated salary, and purchase history.
   - Employed data cleaning techniques to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data consistency.
   - Ensured the dataset's reliability for accurate predictions.

2. **Data Visualization:**
   - Utilized data visualization techniques to explore the relationships between age, estimated salary, and purchases.
   - Created insightful visualizations, such as scatter plots and histograms, to understand the distribution of variables and potential correlations.

3. **Data Splitting and Augmentation:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
   - Applied data augmentation techniques to enhance the diversity of the dataset, improving the models' ability to generalize to new data.

4. **Machine Learning Models:**
   - Implemented a variety of machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and XGBoost Random Forest.
   - Utilized hyperparameter tuning for selected models using RandomSearch CV 1 to optimize model performance.

5. **Model Comparison:**
   - Compared the performance of different models based on their hyperparameter-tuned configurations.
   - Evaluated models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their effectiveness in predicting purchase power.

**Conclusion:**
The "Purchase Power Prediction based on Salary" project addresses a critical aspect of consumer behavior, providing businesses with the tools to tailor their strategies effectively. By employing advanced machine learning models and hyperparameter tuning, the project enhances the accuracy of purchase power predictions. This predictive capability empowers businesses to optimize their marketing efforts, enhance customer targeting, and ultimately improve overall sales performance. The project's importance lies in its potential to contribute to strategic decision-making, customer satisfaction, and business growth.
